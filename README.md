This project explores methods in studying intestinal flora
The main crux of this investigation is where we are in the usage of functional omics in studying the microbiome and whether there need to simply be further evolution in that form of data gathering or if congruent research methods are needed.
Are there giant gaps even with more capable omes?
What other methods of study could supply necessary data?
